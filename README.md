This is i think my best 'official' daggerheart character creator with a decent enough character sheet to bring to a table or use online to mark tokens and such. I've followed Demiplane and the rules as best as makes sense, but particularily Demiplane's model and integrated it within (i think lol) But the more people testing it out to verify things are as they should, the better. Play around and make some characters! It can save/load locally! There's a Change Equipment screen to check gear out. Gonna add consumables and inventory down the line but for now, just got characters finished and wanted to get eyes on it~
